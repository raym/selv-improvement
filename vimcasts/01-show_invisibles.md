Vim’s `list` feature can be used to reveal hidden characters, such as tabstops and newlines. In this episode, I demonstrate how to customise the appearance of these characters by tweaking the `listchars` setting. I go on to show how to make these invisible characters blend in with your colortheme.

## Show invisibles

TextMate has an option to ‘Show invisibles’, which lets you see tab and end-of-line characters. When this is enabled, tab characters appear as a small triangle (▸), and end of lines appear as a 'not sign' (¬). This is helpful for distinguishing between tabs and spaces, and for revealing trailing spaces at the end of a line.

In Vim, we can display invisible characters by enabling `:set list`. You can hide these characters again by running `:set nolist`, or you can toggle between showing and hiding them by running `:set list!`. If you want to be able to do this quickly, you might like to map the toggling command to something more convenient. Try putting the following in your .vimrc:

```
nmap <leader>l :set list!<CR>
```

Now you can toggle between showing and hiding invisible characters with `\l` (backslash-L). [Note that if you have set your mapleader to a value other than backslash, you will have to use that instead].

## Customize symbols

By default, the tab character is represented literally as `^I`, and end-of-lines are represented by a dollar sign.

We can customise the symbols used to represent invisible characters by changing the `listchars` setting. If you want to use the same symbols as TextMate does, put the following into your .vimrc:

```
set listchars=tab:▸\ ,eol:¬
```

If you like, you can customise other invisible characters besides tabs and end-of-lines. For more information, get help on listchars:

```
:help listchars
```

## Colortheme symbols

Depending on the colorscheme you are using, you may want to change the colors of tab and end-of-lines symbols. I prefer to make them close in color to the background, so that they are only just visible, and not too distracting. The syntax keyword for an end-of-line is “NonText”, and for tab characters it is “SpecialKey”. I have added these lines to my prefered colorscheme file:

```
"Invisible character colors
highlight NonText guifg=#4a4a59
highlight SpecialKey guifg=#4a4a59
```

## Aside on inserting literal characters

You shouldn't have any problems if you copy and paste the `listchars` setting from the shownotes into your .vimrc file. But just in case, here is a method for inserting any Unicode character directly in Vim.

In insert mode, press ctrl-V, then type u followed by the numeric code for the symbol you want to insert. e.g.:

```
ctrl-v u00ac inserts '¬' (the not sign)
ctrl-v u25b8 inserts '▸' (the triangle symbol)
```

You can also insert a tab character in insert mode by typing:

```
ctrl-v ctrl-i
```

As you can see, the default `^I` symbol that Vim uses to represent a tab character is the same as the literal key sequence that we can use to insert this character. So if you’ve ever wondered why `:set` list showed tab characters by default as ‘ctrl-I’, now you know: that’s how Vim represents tab characters internally.
