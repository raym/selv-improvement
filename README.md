my vim trials and tribulations

##absolute beginners

For learning Vim basics with minimum effort, I recommend going through the tutorial on [OpenVim](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html) twice a day -- once in the morning and once before sleep. It should take less than 20 minutes to go through the entire tutorial. This will help you install Vim commands into your memory without doing much work. After a few days, you should be proficient enough to actually start using vim to edit some files.

##.vimrc
To get into configuration, try [vim's .vimrc example](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/vimrc_example.vim).

also checkout some plugins:
